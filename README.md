# Neo-matrix

We get that github is full of people making some awesome matrix rain sequences, but this one is slightly unique.

This one tries to simulate the vision Neo gets after waking up after being shot by the agents.

What we were able to get with our feeble skills at opencv is a watered down version of the matrix effects.
This code is fast enough to execute in real-time though.

Take a look.
But please don't laugh.
