# Neo-matrix

Dependencies: numpy, opencv-python

We get that github is full of people making some awesome matrix rain sequences, but this one is slightly unique.

This one tries to simulate the vision Neo gets after waking up after being shot by the agents.

What we were able to get with our feeble skills at opencv is a watered down version of the matrix effects.
This code is fast enough to execute in real-time though.
The main code is written to give a feel of what can happen. If you have a webcam,you can try out running the code.

Take a look.
But please don't laugh.
